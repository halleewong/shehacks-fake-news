## Implemented Solution
We relied on the Google Cloud Natural Language API to measure the sentiment analysis of different news articles. With the sentiment score of an article, we can infer whether an article is more opinionated or factual. 

We deployed a web application in Flask that uses some of the Google Cloud APIs. It allows the user to enter a phrase, headline, or article. This input is passed to the Natural Language API to get a list of the most relevant keywords in it. Finally, these keywords are used to find similar articles from the following news sourcesâ€” Fox News, The New York Times, CNN, The Washington Post, Google News, The New Yorker, The Economist, NBC News, ABC News, and CBS News. 

To visually represent the data obtained, a pie graph with the sentiment scores is used to represent the percentage of the similar articles that have a positive, negative, or a neutral tone.
